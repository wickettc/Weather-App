Weather App created with React utilizing OpenWeatherAPI and the Google Maps & Places API

Live App: https://weather-app.wickettc.vercel.app/

---------------------------------

This project really helped me solidify my knowlege of consuming APIs and displaying the relevant information. Using the axios package, I was able to fetch data from OpenWeatherAPI quickly and easily and used React to display that information to the user. A few things I learned in this project that will really stick with me was first, setting up the GoogleMaps API. Just getting everthing configured correctly and really having to dig deep into some of the documentation to get everything working how I wanted. Second, using the GeolocateAPI to get user's latitude and longitude to pass over to Google. Third, was using the useEffect hook in React, getting everything to run in the correct order and making sure to follow the exhaustive-deps rule took some reading and experimenting, but I finally got everything figured out and running correctly!
